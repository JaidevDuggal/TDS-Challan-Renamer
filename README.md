# 🐍 TDS Challan Renamer (Income Tax Automation Tool)

## 🚀 Project Overview
This Python-based automation tool is designed to solve a common, tedious problem faced by CA Professionals and Accountants: **renaming bulky income tax challan PDFs**.

It intelligently extracts key information—like **Section**, **Challan No.**, and **Entity Name**—directly from the PDF content and renames the file into a standardized, searchable format.

---

## ✨ Features
* **Standardized Naming:** Renames files to a uniform and professional format for easy sorting and searchability (e.g., `Section_Challan_No_Entity_Name.pdf`).
* **One-Click Usability:** Compiled into a single `.exe` file for easy execution without needing to install Python or dependencies.
* **Bulk Processing:** Processes an entire folder of challans with a single command.

## 🛠️ How to Use (Pre-Compiled .EXE)

If you just want to run the tool, follow these steps:

1.  **Download the latest `.exe`:** [Insert Google Drive/External Link to .EXE here]
2.  **Run the file.**
3.  The application will prompt you to **enter the full path of the folder** containing your Challan PDFs.
4.  Enter the path (e.g., `C:\Users\Public\MyChallans`) and press Enter.
5.  All challans in that folder will be automatically renamed.
